Time for business! In Making Bank, players act as budding firms, big banks, or the government.  
As a firm, players will engage in a risky game of dice to raise funds and profit -- and hopefully pay back their loans!  
Banks, on the other hand, manage loans and deposits to edge the other banks out of the market.  
All the while, the government tries to slow down the firms and banks before they drive the economy to hyperinflation!
