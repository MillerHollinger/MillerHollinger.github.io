Aves was our entry for Sula Feet's Print and Play Card Game Jam.
  
In Aves (Spanish for “Birds”), players take on the roles of hungry birds.
Seek out the best grubs to score points and gain special powers.
Outwit your opponents and rule the skies!
Aves features a huge bundle of fan-favorite mechanics, including set collection, bluffing, and risk-reward.
