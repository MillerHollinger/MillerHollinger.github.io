The world is heating, and only the players, by controlling different countries, can stop it!  
In this game, players work together to stop global warming while acting as different countries.  
Some types of countries can industrialize cheaply while others efficiently dispatch pollution.  
This is a zero-sum game, meaning players must work for the benefit of the group or everyone loses!
