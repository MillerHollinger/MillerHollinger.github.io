Rapidly take one-second turns playing one card. Lock to take another turn. Pass to move the turn to the next player. Counter to reverse the turn order. You can only draw cards when it's not your turn.  
If you go out of turn or take too long, it's over! You have to take all the cards played this round into your deck. Empty your hand and personal deck to win the game!
