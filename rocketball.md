Rocketball is a free-for-all sci-fi sports game on the games platform Roblox.  
In Rocketball, players go toe-to-toe in an action-packed battle to be the last alive.  

Get hit and you're out -- but the fun doesn't stop there.
Take your spectral revenge as a Ghost and tag other players to get them out!  

Rocketball also features an item system with 100+ unique collectible trails, rings, and emotes.  
Players can also trade items to get the cosmetics they want.  

Rocketball was in development from December 27 2019 to March 30 2020.
