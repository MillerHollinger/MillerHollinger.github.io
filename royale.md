**Royale** was our entry for Button Shy's October 18 Card Challenge.  

October's restriction was **No Table**. The game can't use a table or other surface: All cards must be held in hand!

Royale is a five player all-versus exchange and bluffing game about starting a revolution.
One player is the King, the rest are Citizens working secretly to rise up.  
Citizens will have to work together covertly, smuggling Gold and Glory to launch a revolt!  

Royale is produced and sold by Button Shy.
