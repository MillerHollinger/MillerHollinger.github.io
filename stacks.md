Stacks is a compact bluffing game where the stakes are high and they keep raising.  
Play cards into your Stack to score points. Increase the bid to match your Stack.  
Get caught lying and lose it all. Catch someone else and steal everything they’ve got.  
Stacks is easy to learn and immensely fun to play. It’s a perfect mix of supercharged luck and laugh-out-loud deception that will have you coming back again and again.  

Stacks is a 3-4 player game that takes about a minute from dealing the cards to scoring the round. Play a few rounds at lunch or a few hundred.
