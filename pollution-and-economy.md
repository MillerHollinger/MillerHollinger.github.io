It's time to industrialize -- but hold on! The government's limiting pollution with licenses!  
In Pollution and Economy, players take on the role of a factory boss, machine producer, or consumer.  
Factory bosses buy machines and use them to make the goods the public craves.  
Machine producers hire consumers and upgrade their machines to sell for big bucks.  
Consumers play totally differently and instead try to get the best deals on the hottest products!  
Over all this is a system of licenses that demonstrates how pollution licensing can encourage pro-environment innovation but drive up costs.
